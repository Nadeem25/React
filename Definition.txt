1. What is React?
Open source library for building User Interface.
--> Not Framework
--> Focus on UI
--> It has Component Base Architecture
--> It is declarative: Tell react what we want and it will build actual UI.


2. Component: It describe the part of the UI.
    1. Stateless Function Component: Javascript function which return HTML that describe UI.
    2. Stateful Class Component: Class extend Component Class and render method returns HTML.

3. Higher Order Component
We use Higher Order Component to share common functionality between component
HOC: Function takes component as an argument and returns a new call.
const newComponent = higherOrderComponent(originalComponetn)
Eg. const IronMan = withSuit(TonyStark)


4. render props: We use render props to share common functionaliy and props between components.

5. Context: It provides a way to pass data through the components tree without having to pass props down manually at entry level.
  step 1: Create Context
  step 2: Provide a context value
  step 3: Consume the context value
