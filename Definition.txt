1. What is React?
Open source library for building User Interface.
--> Not Framework
--> Focus on UI
--> It has Component Base Architecture
--> It is declarative: Tell react what we want and it will build actual UI.


2. Component: It describe the part of the UI.
    1. Stateless Function Component: Javascript function which return HTML that describe UI.
    2. Stateful Class Component: Class extend Component Class and render method returns HTML.

3. Higher Order Component
We use Higher Order Component to share common functionality between component
HOC: Function takes component as an argument and returns a new call.
const newComponent = higherOrderComponent(originalComponetn)
Eg. const IronMan = withSuit(TonyStark)


4. render props: We use render props to share common functionaliy and props between components.

5. Context: It provides a way to pass data through the components tree without having to pass props down manually at entry level.
  step 1: Create Context
  step 2: Provide a context value
  step 3: Consume the context value

6. Rules Of Hook
--> Only call Hooks at the Top Level
Dont call Hooks inside loops, conditions or nested function

--> Only Call Hooks from React Functions
Call them from within React Functional Components and not just any regular javascript function

7. Summary of Hooks
1. The useState hook let us add state to functional component
2. In classes, the state is always an object, but with useState hook the state does not have to be an object
3. It return an array with 2 elements
4. 1st element is the current value of state and 2nd element is state setter function.

Types of Hooks
1. useState
2. UseEffect
3. UseContext
4. UseReducer
